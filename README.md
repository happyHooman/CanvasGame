##Todo
- [x] finish Player class
- [ ] remove issues when multiple arrows are fired at the same time and then one of them is released
- [ ] forbid this tiny creature go outside the bounds of the canvass

- [ ] make it throw stones (like the cave man, just wandering where that cave man got clothes from :confused: )(sorry but no animation for that yet)
- [ ] make the character drop bombs like bomberman

- [ ] make it possible to have 2 characters played from the same keyboard(wasd and arrowkeys)

- [ ] create node server to enable players from different computers play together
